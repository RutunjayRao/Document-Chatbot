# DocumentGPT

Using LangChain and ChatGPT a multi-document reader and Chatbot is made. It can read documents in any form (pdf, text, csv) and remember previous conversations.

We can see a few prompts and the chatbot's replies below:

Documents in docs1: (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Chapter 3 : https://coundon-coventry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosophers-Stone-Chapter-3.pdf)

We are using 'gpt-3.5'; 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k' can also be used (worked in local repo)

I have not used more than 2 files since I have a limit on the number of tokens by OpenAI, but you can use more files if you need in your local repo.
